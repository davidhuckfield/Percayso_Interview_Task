# Percayso Programming Exercise 4

## Brief

Write functions that:

1. Given a long number, returns all the possible sum of two digits of it.

For example, 12345: all possible sum of two digits from that number are:

[ 1 + 2, 1 + 3, 1 + 4, 1 + 5, 2 + 3, 2 + 4, 2 + 5, 3 + 4, 3 + 5, 4 + 5 ]
Therefore the result must be:

[ 3, 4, 5, 6, 5, 6, 7, 7, 8, 9 ]

2. Given the output of the first function, returns the number

- Think carefully about any error handling that may be required.
- Unit tests should be produced to ensure all functionality works as expected.

This repo is set up for your solution to be written in Typescript, but if you don't know Typescript, you can submit your solution in a language of your choice.

We are looking to understand your approach to solving this problem as much as the actual technical solution. Add comments to your code to help us understand your thinking.

Googling syntax is allowed, googling solutions is not.

## Submitting your solution

Please commit your solution within the time frame given to you, even if your solution is not complete. We will be interested in seeing how you approached the problem.

## Extra credit

If you're in the mood for showboating, plese feel free to show us what else you can do. E.g. you could automate tests for your solution.
